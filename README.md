# Finance-Multiple-rates
This python script uses the exchangerate.host API to obtain the percentage change in the exchange rates of 160+ currencies. The script uses the Fluctuation endpoint to access the percentage change between two dates, which in this case are yesterday and the previous day. This involves collecting the percentage change of the exchange rate of each currency relative to the other currencies and creating a 2D matrix of these rates. The script can also be prompted to collect weekly rather than daily data. The data is exported to a .csv file which can be used for further analysis.
